Tableau data analysis and visualization example
Example of Tableau data cleaning and visualization skills. 

Note: This project was developed using Tableau Desktop version 2025.1 

Since, I've become a Graduate Assistant for DTSC600 at Eastern University (Philadelphia, PA), and teach Tableau on the most current desktop version.

The csv file "Regional Sales" is the data used for this example.
